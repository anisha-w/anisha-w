#### 👩‍💻 Currently working on : [Task Organizer Project](https://github.com/anisha-w/TaskOrganizer/blob/main/README.md)
I love planning my day and moving tasks around—it’s really satisfying! This led me to create TaskOrganizer. It’s a simple web app that lets you create tasks, color-code them, and drop them onto a calendar.
